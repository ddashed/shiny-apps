**About project**:
University project for master's thesis - an application that analyzes hotel booking data and predicts booking cancellations using machine learning methods. 
The results of ML models are further explained using the DALEX package in R. 
The application was created using the Shiny package in R in collaboration with university colleagues - Milana Morozova and Ahmar Anees.
